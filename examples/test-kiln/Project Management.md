### Critical Path Analysis

The critical path for the Knowledge Management System includes:
1. Architecture design → Core development → UI implementation → Testing → Deployment
2. Any delays in core development will impact subsequent phases

## Resource Management

### Team Allocation

#### Current Team Members
- **Sarah Chen**: Project Manager, 40% allocation
- **Michael Rodriguez**: Lead Developer, 100% allocation
- **Emily Watson**: UX Designer, 60% allocation
- **David Kim**: Backend Developer, 80% allocation
- **Lisa Johnson**: QA Engineer, 50% allocation

### Budget Tracking

#### KM System Budget Breakdown
- Personnel: $35,000
- Software licenses: $5,000
- Hardware/Infrastructure: $7,000
- Training and development: $3,000

**Total Budget**: $50,000
**Spent to Date**: $18,500
**Remaining**: $31,500

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

#### High Risk
- **Technical Complexity**: Integration with existing systems may be more complex than anticipated
- **Resource Availability**: Key team members may be pulled to other projects

#### Medium Risk
- **Timeline Slippage**: Development may take longer than planned
- **Scope Creep**: Additional requirements may be added during development

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular risk assessment meetings
- Buffer time in project schedules
- Cross-training team members
- Clear change control processes

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- **Weekly Progress Reports**: Every Friday
- **Monthly Steering Committee**: First Thursday of each month
- **Quarterly Reviews**: End of each quarter

### Meeting Cadence
- **Daily Standups**: Development team (15 minutes)
- **Weekly Team Meetings**: Project coordination (1 hour)
- **Bi-weekly Stakeholder Updates**: Progress review (30 minutes)

## Integration with Other Systems

This project management system integrates with:

- [[Meeting Notes]] for action item tracking
- [[Contact Management]] for resource assignment
- [[Technical Documentation]] for specification references
- [[Knowledge Management Hub]] for cross-project knowledge sharing

## Search Testing Targets

This note provides search testing for:

- **Project Status**: "in progress", "planning phase", "backlog"
- **Priority Levels**: "high priority", "critical tasks"
- **Date Queries**: Projects due in specific timeframes
- **Team Members**: Search by project manager or team member names
- **Budget Information**: Financial tracking and resource allocation
- **Milestone Tracking**: Completion status and deadlines

## Performance Metrics
