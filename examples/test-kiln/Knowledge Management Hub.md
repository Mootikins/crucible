# Knowledge Management Hub

This note serves as the central hub for organizing and navigating the knowledge management system. It demonstrates various link types and frontmatter properties for comprehensive testing.

## Core Concepts

Knowledge management is the systematic process of creating, sharing, using, and managing an organization's information and knowledge. It involves:

- **Knowledge Capture**: Documenting insights and experiences
- **Knowledge Organization**: Structuring information for discoverability
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Making information accessible to others
- **Knowledge Application**: Using knowledge to inform decisions

## System Architecture Overview

The knowledge management system consists of several interconnected components:

![[Technical Documentation]]

### Key Areas

#### Project Management
For tracking ongoing initiatives and their progress:
- See [[Project Management]] for active projects
- Timeline management and milestone tracking
- Resource allocation and dependency mapping

#### Research Methodology
For academic and professional research approaches:
- Consult [[Research Methods]] for systematic approaches
- Literature review strategies
- Data collection and analysis techniques

#### Information Organization
For structuring content effectively:
- Tag-based categorization system
- Relationship mapping between concepts
- Hierarchical topic organization

## Advanced Features

### Link Types Demonstration

This hub demonstrates various link types supported by the system:

1. **Basic Wikilinks**: [[Technical Documentation]]
2. **Alias Links**: [[Project Management|Project Tracking]]
3. **Heading Links**: [[Research Methods#Literature Review]]
4. **Block References**: [[Meeting Notes#^2024-01-15-key-decisions]]
5. **Embedded Content**: ![[Reading List#Books to Read]]
