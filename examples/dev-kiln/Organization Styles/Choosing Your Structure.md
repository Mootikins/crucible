# Choosing Your Structure

Choosing an organizational approach can feel overwhelming. This guide helps you select a starting point based on your needs, context, and preferences.

## Quick Decision Guide

### Start with PARA if you...
- Juggle multiple active projects with deadlines
- Need clear boundaries between active work and reference
- Want to focus on actionable items
- Are building a personal productivity system

### Start with Johnny Decimal if you...
- Need stable, predictable organization
- Work in teams with shared reference systems
- Manage large archives or documentation
- Value being able to cite items by ID

### Start with Zettelkasten if you...
- Focus on research, learning, or writing
- Want ideas to connect organically
- Prefer bottom-up organization
- Build knowledge over long time horizons

### Start with MOCs if you...
- Already have notes but need better navigation
- Want flexible, evolving organization
- Need multiple perspectives on the same content
- Prefer lightweight structure

## Questions to Consider

### 1. What's your primary use case?

**Project management / productivity:**
→ PARA gives clear actionability signals

**Research / writing / learning:**
→ Zettelkasten excels at building connections

**Reference / documentation:**
→ Johnny Decimal provides stable structure

**Mixed use:**
→ Consider combining approaches

### 2. How stable are your categories?

**Very stable (rarely change):**
→ Johnny Decimal works well with fixed hierarchies

**Moderately stable:**
→ PARA adapts as projects complete

**Constantly evolving:**
→ Zettelkasten and MOCs embrace emergence

### 3. Do you work alone or with others?

**Solo:**
→ Any approach works; optimize for your thinking style

**Team with shared kiln:**
→ Johnny Decimal or clear PARA structure for consistency

**Team with individual kilns:**
→ Flexible approaches like Zettelkasten

### 4. How much maintenance are you willing to do?

**Minimal maintenance:**
→ Zettelkasten (structure emerges organically)

**Regular reviews:**
→ PARA (needs archiving discipline)

**Upfront investment, low ongoing:**
→ Johnny Decimal (stable after setup)

## Starting Simple

If you're unsure, start with the simplest approach that might work:

### Phase 1: Just Start Writing

Don't organize yet. Write notes. See what patterns emerge.

### Phase 2: Add Light Structure

Create a few obvious folders based on what you're creating:
```
notes/
  projects/
  reference/
  ideas/
```

### Phase 3: Adopt a System

Once you understand your needs, choose a formal approach and refactor.

## Common Patterns

### Personal Knowledge Management

A common hybrid for personal use:

```
PARA at top level:
  Projects/ (active work)
  Areas/ (ongoing responsibilities)
  Resources/ (Zettelkasten-style atomic notes)
  Archive/ (completed/inactive)
```

### Project Documentation

For software or technical projects:

```
Domain-driven folders:
  architecture/
  api/
  user-guides/

With MOCs for navigation:
  Architecture Overview.md (links to relevant notes)
  API Reference.md (index of API docs)
```

### Team Knowledge Base

For shared organizational knowledge:

```
Johnny Decimal for stability:
  10-19 Engineering/
  20-29 Product/
  30-39 Operations/

With tags for cross-cutting:
  #onboarding
  #process
  #decision
```

## Don't Overthink It

Remember:
- **Organization is a tool, not a goal.** Optimize for finding and using information.
- **You can always refactor.** With wikilinks, moving files is easy.
- **Perfect is the enemy of good.** A simple system you use beats a complex one you don't.
- **Structure should serve content.** Create content first, organize as patterns emerge.

## Evolution is Normal

Your organizational needs will change. That's fine.

- Projects complete → move to archive
- Interests shift → categories evolve
- Understanding deepens → structure refines

Build systems that can adapt, not ones that resist change.

## Practical Next Steps

1. **If starting fresh:** Pick the simplest approach that might work. You can evolve later.

2. **If already have notes:** Create MOC index notes to add navigation. Refactor structure gradually.

3. **If current system isn't working:** Identify what's broken, then selectively adopt elements from other approaches.
