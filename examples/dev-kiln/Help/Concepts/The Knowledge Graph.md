# The Knowledge Graph

When you link notes together with `[[wikilinks]]`, you're building a **knowledge graph** - a web of connected ideas that grows more valuable as you add to it.

## Links Create Structure

Every `[[link]]` you write creates a connection:

```markdown
# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of [[Artificial Intelligence]] that
focuses on learning from [[Data]] rather than explicit programming.

Key concepts:
- [[Neural Networks]]
- [[Training Data]]
- [[Overfitting]]
```

These links define relationships. Over time, clusters of related notes emerge naturally.

## Why Links Matter

Links do three things:

1. **Navigation** - Move between related ideas quickly
2. **Discovery** - Find notes you forgot about through connections
3. **Context** - See how ideas relate to each other

## Backlinks

Every link goes both ways. When Note A links to Note B, Note B knows about it. This creates "backlinks" - a list of everything that references a note.

You didn't have to create those connections manually. They emerge from your natural writing.

## Links vs Folders

| Folders | Links |
|---------|-------|
| One location per note | Many connections per note |
| Hierarchy | Network |
| Exclusive categories | Overlapping relationships |
| Decided upfront | Emerges naturally |

You can use both. Folders organize files; links organize ideas.

## Building Your Graph

**Start small:**
- Link when you think of a connection
- Don't force links that don't feel natural
- Review notes occasionally and add links you missed

**Let structure emerge:**
- Clusters of densely-linked notes appear over time
- Hub notes (like [[Index]]) help navigation
- You'll notice patterns in how you think
