# Organization Styles

There's no single right way to organize a kiln. The structure that works best depends on your goals, the type of knowledge you're managing, and how you prefer to think and work.

This section explores several well-established organizational approaches. Each has strengths and tradeoffs. You can adopt one fully, mix elements from several, or invent your own system entirely.

## Available Styles

### [[PARA]]
**Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive**

A productivity-focused system that organizes information by actionability. Projects are time-bound efforts with goals, Areas are ongoing responsibilities, Resources are reference materials, and Archive stores completed work.

Best for: Task-oriented work, personal productivity systems, managing active projects alongside reference material.

### [[Johnny Decimal]]
**Numbered Category System**

A hierarchical system using decimal numbering (10-19, 20-29, etc.) to create a fixed structure with predictable locations. Every item has a unique number, making it easy to reference and find.

Best for: Large collections requiring predictable structure, teams needing shared reference systems, archives with stable categories.

### [[Zettelkasten]]
**Atomic Linked Notes**

A bottom-up approach focused on small, atomic notes that link densely to each other. Structure emerges organically from connections rather than predetermined hierarchies.

Best for: Research, writing, learning, exploratory thinking, building interconnected knowledge over time.

### Maps of Content (MOCs)
**Navigation Hubs**

Index notes that provide curated views into related content. Unlike rigid hierarchies, MOCs are flexible overlays that can intersect and evolve.

Best for: Navigating large collections, creating multiple perspectives on the same content, combining with other organizational styles.

## Comparison

| Style | Best For | Strengths | Tradeoffs |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **PARA** | Active work and projects | Clear actionability, reduces clutter | Requires maintenance, categories can blur |
| **Johnny Decimal** | Stable reference systems | Predictable locations, easy to cite | Rigid structure, harder to refactor |
| **Zettelkasten** | Research and learning | Flexible, discovers connections | Requires discipline, slower to navigate initially |
| **MOCs** | Navigation and curation | Flexible, multiple views | Manual curation needed, can become stale |

## Choosing an Approach

The right organizational style depends on your context:

### Personal Knowledge Management
- **PARA** works well if you're juggling active projects
- **Zettelkasten** excels for deep research and learning
- **MOCs** complement either approach by providing flexible navigation

### Project Documentation
- **Component/feature folders** often make the most sense (e.g., `auth/`, `api/`, `ui/`)
- **Domain-driven structure** for larger systems
- **MOCs** can provide cross-cutting views

### Organizational Knowledge
- **Team/domain hierarchy** (e.g., `engineering/`, `marketing/`)
- **Johnny Decimal** for departments with stable category systems
- **PARA** adapted for organizational contexts

## Mix and Match

These styles aren't mutually exclusive. Many effective kilns combine elements:

- Use PARA at the top level, Zettelkasten within Resources
- Apply Johnny Decimal to stable categories, MOCs for cross-cutting themes
- Organize projects by domain, individual notes as atomic Zettels

The key is intentionality: understand why you're organizing a particular way and adjust as you learn what works.

## Getting Started

If you're unsure where to begin, see [[Choosing Your Structure]] for decision guidance.

Remember: organization is a tool, not a goal. Start simple, let complexity emerge naturally, and refactor as patterns become clear.
