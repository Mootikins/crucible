# GBNF Grammar for CLI Passthrough Tool Calling
# Simpler format: command args (directly executable)
#
# The model knows these commands from training:
# - rg: ripgrep (content search)
# - fd: fd-find (file search)
# - cat: read files
# - ls: list directory
#
# This grammar whitelists commands and allows any args

root ::= command " " args

command ::= "rg" | "fd" | "cat" | "ls"

# Allow any non-newline characters as args
args ::= [^\n]+
